1. Java ia a high-level and object oriented programming language. Java was introduced by sun microsystem and recently it was undertaken by 
by oracle corporation and it was released by 1995. java is widely known for its platform independent. Java can be compiled in bytecode 
we can write and compile the java in one platform and we can run the java in another platform using JVM(Java Virtual Machine).

2. JDK-Java Development Kit.
   JRE-Java Runrime Environment.
   JVM-Java Virtual Machine-normally it perform some operations on code like:
 ->Verifies the code.
 ->Executes the code.
 ->Provide a runtime environment.

3. .Java file- it is an extension to save the java programming file. To compile and run the code we should save the code in .java extension.
   .class file- After creating a class to the particular program it saves as a separate class file, it will be encrypted in a non-readable language.

4.Java IDE's are:
 Eclipse
NetBeans
BlueJ
JDeveloper
MyEclipse
Greenfoot
jGRASP
jCreator

5. Variable- variable is the value which is used to store some values init.Variables are the data containers that save the data values during Java program execution. There are 3 types of variables.
->Local variable
->Instance variable
->Static variable

6. Object-Oriented in java means it is a way to communicate with a computer using programming language.
 is a computer programming model tht has both states and behaviour.

7. nullpointer exception.

8. Data Type- Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 
Types are:
->int
->String
->boolean
->char
->float
->double
->long int 
->short int

9. The dot operator (“.”) is used frequently to access a field or to call a method on an object.
 The dot operator is also used to form qualified names.

10. Java feature:
->Simple: java is easy programming language and its syntax is also simple unlike c and c++.
->Platform-Independent: java can be run on any different OS with the help of JVM.
->Security: java has a great part for its security, we can create virus free system.
->Robust:

11. Array-It is a collection of contigeous element. By using array we save lot of space using array we assign 2 or more values to the 
single variable instead of creating separate variable for each value. an array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same data type.
 
Eg: public class Example{
     int[] arrayex={10,20,30,40};
    Example(int[] arrayex){
    this.arrayex=arrayex;
    }
    void getarray(){
    for(int i=0;i>n;i++){
    System.out.println("array"+arrayex[i]);
    }
    }
}
public class RunEx{
public static void main(String[] args){
Example ex=new Example();
ex.getarray();
}
}

12. Class- class is a blueprint of an object and it is a template used to create objects and to define object data types and method.
    Objects- 

13. Keywords are built-in types which value cannot be changed. Keywords are:
->enum, int,void,String,this,static, boolean,float,class,public.

14. Constructor- A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
Constructor name should be same as class name. it does not contain anytype of access specifier.Its types are:
->Default constructor
->No parameter constructor
->Parameterized constructor

16.  public class Example1{
     int[] arrayex1={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
    Example1(int[] arrayex1){
    this.arrayex=arrayex;
    }
    void getarray1(){
    for(int i=0;i>n;i++){
    System.out.println("array"+arrayex1[i]);
    }
    }
}
public class RunEx2{
public static void main(String[] args){
Exampless ex2=new Exampless();
ex2.getarray1();
}
}


17. Method overloading-a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters.
